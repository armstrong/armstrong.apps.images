armstrong.apps.images
=====================
This package provides images for the Armstrong CMS.


State of Project
----------------
Armstrong is an open-source news platform that is freely available to any
organization.  It is the result of a collaboration between the `Texas Tribune`_
and `Bay Citizen`_, and a grant from the `John S. and James L. Knight
Foundation`_.  The first release is scheduled for June, 2011.

To follow development, be sure to join the `Google Group`_.

``armstrong.apps.images`` is part of the `Armstrong`_ project.  You're
probably looking for that.
